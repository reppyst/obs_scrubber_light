# obs_scrubber_light
The OBS Scrubber Importer Light is currently designed to manipulate essentially all OBS
Scenario data provided from a JTDS generated XML. The use-case for this software
differs from site-to-site and system-to-system, so I have hopefully provided enough
tools available to accommodate your needs.

History:
 This tool was originally designed as a way to Import and Convert an ODIN Workbook
due to the lack of JTDS implementation.
 The next revision was to enable the manipulation of current OBS data without having
to regenerate or risk changing already in-place data.
 A follow up to the revisions was the ability to select and merge aspects of multiple
OBS and ODIN data into a single file.
 Finally, we are at a point where you can create your own unique data and builds 
entirely within the program. This should not replace the JTDS development as a whole, 
and may not be suitable for all needs but allows for further customization and 
freedom.
