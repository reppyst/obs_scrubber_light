  installer.
  • PyInstaller bootloader: pyinstaller-6.13.0.dist-info/COPYING.txt – contains GPLv2-or-later plus the PyInstaller
  exception; include it exactly as provided.
  • PyQt6 bindings: pyqt6-6.9.1.dist-info/licenses/LICENSE – full GNU General Public License v3 text.
  • PyQt6-Qt6 runtime: pyqt6_qt6-6.9.2.dist-info/LICENSE – full GNU Lesser General Public License v3 text plus Qt
  attribution notice.
  • Qt WebEngine runtime: pyside6_qtwebengine-6.9.2.dist-info/LICENSE – includes the Qt LGPLv3 text and Chromium
  third-party notices. Ship the entire license directory.
  • milsymbol.js: Symbols/milsymbol.js – MIT License text included below. Keep the upstream header intact.
  • numpy wheel: numpy-2.1.2.dist-info/LICENSE.txt – includes the NumPy BSD license, OpenBLAS BSD-3 license, LAPACK BSD-
  3-attribution terms, and the GCC runtime library exception. Append this entire file so the downstream package receives
  every notice.
